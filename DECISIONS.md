# DECISIONS.md

Architectural decisions with rejected alternatives and the reason for rejection. Add an entry at
the moment a decision is made, not retroactively.

## D-01: Core is `no_std`-compatible from day one

Feature flags `std` / `alloc` / `no_std` from the first commit.

**Rejected:** `std`-only core with embedded support bolted on later. Rejected because STM32
(Cortex-M) and ESP32 (Xtensa/RISC-V) are genuinely different architectures, not variants of one —
retrofitting `no_std` after the API has hardened would mean a core rewrite, not an addition.

## D-02: DSTU 4145 signatures — wrap, don't reimplement, for Java/.NET

Java/.NET bindings wrap Bouncy Castle's `DSTU4145Signer`. The Rust implementation, when built, uses
Bouncy Castle as a second verification oracle alongside official test vectors.

**Rejected:** reimplementing DSTU 4145 from scratch in the native core for all languages. Rejected
because Bouncy Castle's implementation has decades of production use and continuous external
audit — duplicating that from scratch buys nothing and adds unaudited surface area.

## D-03: Argon2id stays as the non-DSTU password-hashing component

`crypto_pwhash` equivalent is plain Argon2id, documented explicitly as the one deliberately
non-DSTU component.

**Rejected:** inventing a "national" password-hashing/KDF-from-password construction. Rejected
because no DSTU standard covers this, and Argon2 is the audited winner of an open international
competition (Password Hashing Competition) — there is no security rationale to displace it, only
a cosmetic one.

## D-04: CSPRNG is the OS-provided generator, not a custom design

`randombytes` equivalent uses the system CSPRNG (`getrandom` in Rust), same as libsodium itself.

**Rejected:** a custom or "national" random number generator. Rejected because RNG design is the
single highest-risk area for homegrown cryptography — no benefit justifies the risk here.

## D-05: `secretbox` equivalent is Kalyna encryption + separate Kupyna-based MAC (encrypt-then-MAC)

Symmetric AEAD is built as: Kalyna in a stream-like mode (CTR/OFB-style) for confidentiality, plus
an independent MAC keyed from Kupyna, encrypt-then-MAC, with distinct encryption and
authentication keys.

**Rejected:** treating Kalyna alone as an AEAD primitive (à la AES-GCM). Rejected because the DSTU
7624 text itself specifies that confidentiality + integrity requires combining with DSTU 7564
(Kupyna) on separate keys — there is no single-primitive AEAD in the standard to call instead. See
`docs/dstu-crypto-project.md` libsodium-mapping section.

**Not yet reconciled:** PrivatBank's cryptonite (`oracles/cryptonite/src/cryptonite/c/dstu7624.h`)
exposes `dstu7624_init_ccm` / `dstu7624_init_gcm` with a paired `dstu7624_encrypt_mac` /
`dstu7624_decrypt_mac` API — Kalyna alone, in CCM/GCM-style modes, producing authenticated
ciphertext without Kupyna. This is in tension with the rejection above and needs checking against
the actual DSTU 7624 standard text (not currently among `docs/papers/`) before this decision is
finalized either way — see `oracles/README.md` "Cryptonite" section for the full note. Do not
resolve this from cryptonite's code alone; it's a 2016 third-party implementation, not the spec.

The official text was priced (2026-07-21) to check on this directly: 29,967.60 UAH for 227 pages
(includes Amendment No. 1:2016) via `fnd-store.uas.gov.ua/documents/4228` — see `ORACLES.md`
"Official DSTU text — purchase cost". Deemed cost-prohibitive for now; this tension stays open
until either the price becomes viable or another authoritative source turns up.

## D-06: Reference/oracle repositories are for test-vector comparison only

Kalyna-reference, cryptonite, outspace/dstu8845 are consulted only to cross-verify test vectors,
never as a source to copy code from directly.

**Rejected:** forking/porting code directly from these repos as a shortcut. Rejected on a
per-repo basis: Kalyna-reference has no LICENSE file at all (no legal basis to copy); cryptonite is
BSD-2-Clause (legally forkable) but is 2016-era code whose state certification lapsed in 2021 and
has had no independent audit since — copying it would import unaudited, stale code under the
project's own name. See `docs/dstu-crypto-project.md` "Reference implementations and oracles".

## D-07: The `li0ard` GitHub account is excluded entirely — untrusted supply chain

`li0ard`'s TypeScript/Go packages for Kalyna/Kupyna/Strumok/DSTU 4145 are not used as a
dependency, not used as an oracle, and not linked from any project documentation. This is
stricter than D-06: other unaudited repos there are at least allowed as oracles; `li0ard` is
excluded from that category too.

**Rejected:** treating `li0ard`'s packages as one more unaudited-but-usable oracle, the same
tier as `outspace/dstu8845`. Rejected per the project owner's explicit call: unverified maintainer
identity and provenance, flagged as a potential compromise/trust risk. For a library implementing
Ukrainian national cryptographic standards, code or oracle input from a maintainer whose identity
and origin cannot be verified — and who is suspected of ties to a hostile state — is not an
acceptable risk regardless of the code's apparent quality or activity level. If this needs
revisiting later, it requires a new, independently verifiable trust basis, not just an audit of
the code itself.

## D-08: Post-quantum DSTU 8961:2019 (Skelya) and DSTU 9212:2023 (Vershyna) are out of scope

Not implemented, and not to be proposed for implementation, without a separate explicit decision
from the project owner.

**What they are** (context only, for if this is ever revisited): DSTU 8961:2019 "Skelya" —
post-quantum key encapsulation (KEM) and asymmetric encryption on algebraic lattices, the same
problem class as CRYSTALS-Kyber or FrodoKEM, a Ukrainian variant. DSTU 9212:2023 "Vershyna" —
post-quantum digital signature on algebraic lattices with rejection sampling, the post-quantum
counterpart to DSTU 4145.

**Rejected:** folding these into the current MVP/second-priority scope alongside
Kalyna/Kupyna/Strumok/DSTU 4145/DSTU 9041. Rejected because:
- Qualitatively different mathematics (polynomial rings, noise sampling, CPA-to-CCA transforms)
  versus the classical-curve/block-cipher math the rest of this project uses.
- Implementation complexity comparable to all five other in-scope algorithms combined, with a
  higher risk of silent correctness bugs specific to this class — constant-time rejection
  sampling, decryption failure rate, sensitivity to ring-parameter choice.
- Cryptanalysis is younger and thinner here than for internationally vetted PQ schemes: published
  work questions Skelya's "unusual field/ring choice" and probes potential attacks via sub-ring
  structure.
- No vetted Rust implementation of either algorithm exists to start from or use as an oracle —
  would be written from zero, with none of the dual-oracle safety net the rest of this project
  relies on.

If ever taken up, treat as a pair (Skelya + Vershyna together, mirroring the classical 4145+9041
pair) as a distinct Phase 3 / post-quantum track, with an explicit documented warning that its
cryptanalysis maturity is lower than this project's classical DSTU primitives.

## D-09: Two-layer API — `hazmat` (no_std, no RNG) + a future high-level "easy" layer (std/alloc-gated)

The crate's public surface is split the way orion's is: a low-level `dstu_core::hazmat` module
containing direct algorithm implementations with no forced RNG dependency and no safety rails
(caller manages keys/nonces/IVs explicitly where an algorithm needs them) — available in `no_std`
builds — and, layered on top of it later, a higher-level "easy" API mirroring libsodium's
`crypto_*` functions (auto-generated nonces via `OsRng`/`getrandom`, misuse-resistant defaults).
The high-level layer is `std` (or at least `alloc` + an injected RNG) gated, since safe automatic
nonce/key generation needs an RNG source that plain `no_std` doesn't provide.

**Rejected:** a single unified API with no low/high split. Rejected because it forces a choice
this project can't make once and be done with: either the whole crate depends on `OsRng` (breaking
`no_std`/embedded support, against D-01), or the whole crate exposes raw hazmat-style functions
only (breaking the libsodium-style "hard to misuse by default" goal that's this project's whole
reason for existing over rolling your own OpenSSL-style flexible API). The two-layer split lets
both goals hold, each in the layer where it applies — this was an **open question** in an earlier
draft of this file; resolved now because the first primitive (Kupyna, below) needed a home and the
split had to be decided before any code landed under it.

**Status:** `dstu_core::hazmat::kupyna` (Kupyna-256/512) is implemented against this split — see
below. The high-level "easy" layer does not exist yet; nothing in this project needs it before a
keyed/nonce-based primitive (Strumok, or the `crypto_secretbox` construction) is reached.

## D-10: Kupyna (DSTU 7564:2014) implemented in `dstu_core::hazmat::kupyna`

One-shot `Kupyna256::digest`/`Kupyna512::digest`, ported from `docs/pseudocode/kupyna.md`.

**Citations:**
- Algorithm structure (padding, `T`/`T⁺` compression, output transformation): the designers'
  paper, `docs/papers/Kupyna.pdf`, Sections 4–6, as already transcribed into
  `docs/pseudocode/kupyna.md`.
- S-box and MDS-matrix constants: taken byte-for-byte from
  `oracles/kupyna-reference/tables.c` (Roman Oliynykov, Kupyna's own author). Confirmed two ways
  before trusting them: (1) byte-for-byte identical to Kalyna's `sboxes_enc` in
  `oracles/kalyna-reference/tables.c` — the same author's two separate reference repos agree
  exactly, consistent with both papers stating the S-boxes are shared; (2) matches the papers'
  own worked example (`S0(0x23) = 0x4F`, Kalyna.pdf §5.3 / Kupyna.pdf §6.3) at the exact table
  index it should. This is a constants transcription, not a code port, and not subject to the
  D-06 "don't copy oracle code" restriction — the S-box/MDS tables are themselves part of the
  published specification (Appendix A), the same way AES's S-box is a spec constant rather than
  someone's implementation choice.
- Byte-matrix layout (`state[column][row]`, not a word-packed AES-style representation): mirrors
  `oracles/kupyna-reference/kupyna.c` directly (not Bouncy Castle's T-table-fused version) —
  chosen deliberately for transcription safety since this implementation could not be
  compiled/tested locally (no Rust toolchain available in this environment; see
  `.claude.local.md`) and the simpler, more literal port carries less risk of an
  unverifiable transposition/endianness bug than an optimized bit-twiddled one.

**Scope limitation, not a gap to silently paper over:** only byte-aligned messages are supported
(the public API takes `&[u8]`, which cannot represent a bit-level length anyway). This matches
the extracted test vectors exactly — the paper's bit-level cases (N=510/655/33/1) were already
excluded from `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/kupyna/*.json` for the same reason (see the `note`
field in those files).

**Verification status, updated 2026-07-22 after installing a local toolchain (see
`.claude.local.md`): confirmed green, not just written.**
- `cargo test --workspace`: passes, both `Kupyna256`/`Kupyna512` official-vector tests.
- `cargo miri test --workspace`: passes, no UB detected — satisfies the `SECURITY.md` requirement.
- `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings`: clean (one `manual_memcpy` lint fixed in
  `shift_bytes`, no logic change).
- `cargo build --no-default-features` (the `no_std` path): compiles clean.
- Additionally cross-checked against real Bouncy Castle (not this project's own port) via
  `tests/oracle-harness/{dotnet,java}/`, both using the published NuGet/Maven packages: all 10
  Kalyna cases + all 12 Kupyna cases pass. Same caveat as always applies to that cross-check —
  BC's Kalyna/Kupyna is a port of the same C reference, so this mainly confirms the vector
  extraction, not a fully independent second implementation.
- **Still missing:** `cargo fuzz` has a scaffold (`crates/dstu-core/fuzz/`, target `kupyna`) but
  has not actually been run yet (required by `SECURITY.md`); the streaming (`update`/`finalize`)
  API doesn't exist (one-shot `digest()` only); no high-level "easy" wrapper (D-09) yet.
