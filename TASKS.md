# TASKS.md

Progress tracker and task backlog for this project, grouped by phase. Check items off as they're
done; add new items as they're discovered. This file tracks **what** and **status** — the
**why** behind any decision or blocker lives in `DECISIONS.md`/`ORACLES.md`/`SECURITY.md` and is
linked from here, not duplicated.

Per `CLAUDE.md`'s "Agent discipline": every implementation task below is test-first — the
test-vector check (or unit test) is written before the primitive it verifies, not after.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold (done)

- [x] Cargo workspace (`dstu-core` + `dstutool`), dual MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing
- [x] `no_std`/`alloc`/`std` feature flags in place from the first commit (D-01)
- [x] Docs translated to English; repo structure split per GitHub/Rust-crypto conventions
- [x] `SECURITY.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ORACLES.md` written
- [x] Oracle infrastructure pulled and vetted: `kalyna-reference`, `kupyna-reference`,
      `outspace/dstu8845`, `bouncycastle-{java,dotnet}`, `cryptonite` (see `oracles/README.md`)
- [x] `li0ard` excluded as untrusted supply chain (D-07)
- [x] Kalyna (5 variants) + Kupyna (2 variants) official test vectors extracted from the
      designers' papers into `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/`
- [x] Per-algorithm pseudocode docs: Kalyna, Kupyna, Strumok, DSTU 4145
      (`docs/pseudocode/*.md`)
- [x] Post-quantum track (DSTU 8961/9212) explicitly excluded from scope (D-08)

## Phase 1 — MVP: Kalyna + Kupyna + Strumok core

- [x] Implement Kalyna (all 5 block/key-size variants) — `dstu_core::hazmat::kalyna`
      (`Kalyna128_128`/`Kalyna128_256`/`Kalyna256_256`/`Kalyna256_512`/`Kalyna512_512`), citation
      in `DECISIONS.md` D-13. **Confirmed 2026-07-22**: `cargo test` (all 5 variants against the
      official vectors, first attempt, no debugging needed), `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo
      fmt --check`, and the `no_std` build all pass. S-box/MDS tables shared with `hazmat::kupyna`
      via a new `hazmat::tables` module rather than duplicated (D-13). `cargo miri test` also
      confirmed clean (no UB, all 5 variants, ~158s). Same day (D-16 update): UAPKI's
      `dstu7624_ecb_self_test` (single-block case, all 5 variants × encrypt/decrypt) matches
      byte-for-byte too — same official vector set, not a new independent reading. Still open: no
      independent second-oracle cross-check (Java/.NET harnesses don't cover Kalyna vectors yet),
      no mode of operation (D-05) — UAPKI's CBC/OFB/CFB/CTR/CMAC/XTS/KW/CCM/GMAC/GCM self-tests are
      unused KAT data waiting for whenever modes get built, same as Kupyna's KMAC below —
      `dstutool` doesn't call this yet.
- [x] Implement Kupyna (256/512) — `dstu_core::hazmat::kupyna` (`Kupyna256`/`Kupyna512`),
      citation in `DECISIONS.md` D-10. **Confirmed green 2026-07-22**: `cargo test`, `cargo miri
      test` (no UB), `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `no_std` build all pass; independently
      cross-checked against real Bouncy Castle via the .NET and Java oracle harnesses, and (same
      day, D-16 update) UAPKI's `dstu7564_self_test_hash` matches byte-for-byte too — same
      official vector set, not a new independent reading, but confirms UAPKI's numbers agree.
      Still missing: `cargo fuzz` actually run (scaffold exists), the streaming
      (`update`/`finalize`) API (current API is one-shot `digest()` only), the high-level API
      split (D-09) has no wrapper here yet — this is `hazmat` only — and KMAC (Kupyna-based MAC,
      see the `crypto_auth` line below) isn't implemented at all yet.
- [x] **Blocker lifted 2026-07-22 (D-15/D-16), not fully resolved:** found
      https://github.com/specinfo-ua/UAPKI (state-expertise pedigree, see `ORACLES.md`), whose
      `dstu8845.c` self-test is comment-attributed to `// ДСТУ 8845:2019` in its own source — the
      first real KAT found anywhere for this algorithm. Adopted as
      `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/strumok/keystream-{256,512}.json` (an earlier, self-invented
      "gray vector" attempt from the same day was superseded and deleted, not kept). Cross-checked
      against `oracles/strumok-dstu8845/` (byte-identical, but treated as a lineage-sharing
      consistency bonus, not independent confirmation — see D-15) via
      `tests/oracle-harness/strumok-cross-check/cross_check_against_uapki.c`. **Still not
      "official"**: not confirmed against the paid DSTU 8845:2019 text itself.
- [x] Implement Strumok (256/512-bit key) — `dstu_core::hazmat::strumok` (`Strumok256`/
      `Strumok512`), citation in `DECISIONS.md` D-18. **Confirmed 2026-07-22**: all 8
      UAPKI-attributed keystream cases pass on the first attempt, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -D
      warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, `no_std` build, and `cargo miri test` all clean. Structurally
      cross-checked against both `outspace/dstu8845` and `oracles/uapki/.../dstu8845.c` per the
      pseudocode doc; the `T` substitution reuses the shared `hazmat::tables` (no new tables
      needed), `mul_alpha`/`mul_alpha_inv` tables transcribed and cross-checked byte-for-byte
      between the two oracles. **Status line, not to be dropped**: "UAPKI-attributed, not confirmed
      against the official text" (D-15) — implementing this did not change that provenance ceiling.
      `dstutool` doesn't call this yet.
- [x] `cargo miri test` clean for all three primitives (Kalyna/Kupyna/Strumok, each confirmed
      individually above)
- [x] `cargo fuzz` harnesses for all three primitives — `kalyna`, `kupyna`, and `strumok` targets
      all exist now (`crates/dstu-core/fuzz/fuzz_targets/`). **Cannot actually run locally**:
      `cargo-fuzz` installed fine (needed `mingw64/bin`'s `dlltool.exe` on PATH, same requirement
      as `cargo-audit`/`cargo-deny`, see `.claude.local.md`), but building any target fails two
      ways in a row on this environment's GNU/MinGW toolchain — first "address sanitizer is not
      supported for this target" (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, ASan needs MSVC on Windows), then with
      `--sanitizer none`, `libfuzzer-sys`'s own `FuzzerExtFunctionsWindows.cpp` fails to compile
      under `g++` (`__pragma(comment(linker, ...))` is an MSVC-only compiler extension, confirmed
      by compiling that one file directly with `g++` and reading the real error past cc-rs's
      truncated one). **Not something to chase further here**: this project deliberately chose the
      GNU host toolchain specifically to avoid needing Visual Studio Build Tools/MSVC (see
      `.claude.local.md` "Toolchains"), and libFuzzer-on-Windows is an MSVC-only path upstream —
      same shape as the cryptonite C-harness being dropped below (a real, confirmed toolchain
      incompatibility, not a skipped step). CI (a Linux runner) remains the actual venue where
      these targets get run, same as this project already says for the fuzz scaffold generally.
- [ ] `dstutool` CLI: `encrypt`/`decrypt`/`hash` subcommands, mode/nonce/IV hardcoded (no
      user-facing crypto knobs, per the libsodium-style misuse-resistance goal)
- [ ] Publish `dstu-core` to crates.io
- [ ] Prebuilt Windows/Linux binaries via GitHub Releases
- [ ] Re-confirm the `no_std` build still passes (all feature-flag combinations) as each
      primitive lands — don't let this regress silently

## Testing & hardening — deeper verification beyond test vectors

Test vectors answer one question: does the primitive produce the standard's expected output for a
handful of fixed inputs. They do not answer whether the *code* leaks secrets, runs at an acceptable
speed, or degrades safely on adversarial/malformed input — raised 2026-07-22 while reviewing what
"done" means for Kalyna/Kupyna/Strumok now that all three pass their vectors. Split deliberately
from Phase 1 above: none of this blocks calling the primitives implemented, but none of it should
be skipped before calling them *production-ready*. Two things are explicitly **not** goals here and
never will be, so as not to imply otherwise: cryptanalytic strength of the algorithms themselves
(that's the DSTU designers' responsibility, not this library's), and hardware side-channel
resistance (SPA/DPA — explicitly out of scope per `SECURITY.md`/`CLAUDE.md` "MVP scope").

- [x] **Chunk/split-invariance test for `Strumok::apply_keystream`.** Added
      `strumok_{256,512}_chunk_invariance` in `crates/dstu-core/tests/strumok.rs` — splits a fixed
      total length into arbitrary, non-8-aligned chunks (including a zero-length one) and asserts
      byte-for-byte identity against one call on the concatenated buffer. **Passed on the first
      attempt** — no buffering bug found, but the path was genuinely untested before this.
- [x] **Round-trip property tests.** `proptest` 1.11 added as a dev-dependency (`DECISIONS.md`
      D-21) — doesn't touch the `no_std` build. Kalyna: one `decrypt(encrypt(key, block)) == block`
      test per variant in `tests/kalyna.rs`. Strumok: `apply_keystream` applied twice with the same
      key/IV returns the original data, in `tests/strumok.rs`. All 16 property tests (256 generated
      cases each) passed on the first attempt. Kupyna intentionally skipped — no round-trip
      property exists for a hash; its `cargo fuzz` target covers the property that would matter.
- [x] **Differential testing against a C oracle over many random inputs — done for all three.**
      Strumok first (the highest-value target — zero official vectors exist anywhere for it,
      D-15): `cargo run --example strumok_diff_cases -p dstu-core` piped into
      `tests/oracle-harness/strumok-differential/diff_against_outspace.c` (against
      `oracles/strumok-dstu8845/`) — **4000/4000 random cases matched**. `DECISIONS.md` D-22.
      Extended to Kalyna and Kupyna for parity (D-24), so the scrutiny is visibly even across all
      three rather than looking Strumok-only: `kalyna_diff_cases.rs` +
      `kalyna-differential/diff_against_reference.c` against `oracles/kalyna-reference/` —
      **2500/2500 matched**; `kupyna_diff_cases.rs` + `kupyna-differential/
      diff_against_reference.c` against `oracles/kupyna-reference/` — **2000/2000 matched**. All
      three carry the same "not independent, still useful" caveat (these are the same-lineage
      reference implementations already behind Bouncy Castle's own ports, not a new independent
      oracle) — the real independent second reading for Kalyna/Kupyna remains the Java/.NET
      Bouncy Castle harnesses, unchanged.
- [ ] **Actually run `cargo fuzz`** for all three primitives — attempted 2026-07-22, blocked by a
      confirmed GNU/MinGW-toolchain incompatibility (libFuzzer-on-Windows is MSVC-only upstream),
      not a skipped step; full detail in the Phase 1 line above. Still open until it runs somewhere
      that can — CI (Linux) or a machine with the MSVC toolchain.
- [x] **`Zeroize`/`ZeroizeOnDrop` on live key-material.** `zeroize` 1.9 added
      (`default-features = false, features = ["derive"]`, `no_std`-compatible — first real
      dependency in `dstu-core`, `DECISIONS.md` D-20). Strumok's `Core` (LFSR/FSM state) derives
      `ZeroizeOnDrop`; Kalyna's `encrypt_generic`/`decrypt_generic` call `round_keys.zeroize()`
      after last use. Kupyna intentionally untouched — its only API is unkeyed `digest()`, no key
      material exists yet (relevant again once KMAC lands). **Not exhaustive**: Kalyna's
      intermediate key-schedule scratch buffers (`kt`, `initial_data`/`tmv`, the rotation buffer in
      `key_expand_odd`) are still cleared only via the final `round_keys` zeroize, not individually
      — a deliberate scope cut, not an oversight, see D-20.
- [x] **Constant-time audit + an explicit decision.** Confirmed the secret-dependent indexing
      exists in all three primitives (`SBOXES`/`SBOXES_DEC` in `kalyna.rs`/`kupyna.rs`/
      `strumok.rs`, plus `MUL_ALPHA`/`MUL_ALPHA_INV` in `strumok.rs`). Documented and scoped as an
      accepted software-timing exception in `DECISIONS.md` D-19 (same family as the already-out-
      of-scope SPA/DPA carve-out, since every reference C implementation makes the identical
      trade-off) — `SECURITY.md`'s hard-constraint wording updated to say this precisely instead of
      standing as an absolute "never" next to code that already violated it. Branching and
      comparisons on secret data remain prohibited without exception, unchanged.
- [x] **`criterion` benchmarks.** Added as a dev-dependency, three bench targets
      (`crates/dstu-core/benches/{kalyna,kupyna,strumok}.rs`, `cargo bench -p dstu-core`) covering
      every variant of all three primitives. Absolute throughput only, not a regression baseline
      committed anywhere yet (criterion's own `target/criterion/` comparison-across-runs already
      works locally). **Did not** implement a second Strumok state-transition form just to quantify
      the literal-shift-vs-ring-buffer tradeoff mentioned in D-18 — that would mean building and
      maintaining a second implementation purely to benchmark it, out of proportion for this pass;
      the benchmark reports Strumok's own absolute throughput instead, honestly scoped in the
      file's doc comment as not answering that specific comparison.

## Phase 2 — libsodium-equivalent construction layer, DSTU 4145 + 9041

- [ ] Resolve the D-05 open tension (Kalyna+Kupyna encrypt-then-MAC vs. cryptonite's
      Kalyna-alone CCM/GCM `encrypt_mac`) — needs the official DSTU 7624 text or another
      authoritative source (priced, see `ORACLES.md`); blocks `crypto_secretbox` design
- [ ] `crypto_secretbox` equivalent (encrypt-then-MAC construction, once D-05 is resolved)
- [ ] `crypto_auth`/`crypto_onetimeauth` equivalent (Kupyna-based MAC or a Kalyna CMAC-like mode
      — exact mode name TBD against the full DSTU 7624 text). `oracles/uapki/`'s
      `dstu7564_self_test_kmac` (KMAC-256/384/512, D-16 update 2026-07-22) is unused KAT data
      waiting for whenever this gets built — not cross-checked, since there's no KMAC impl yet
- [ ] `crypto_kdf` equivalent (HKDF-like construction over Kupyna)
- [ ] `crypto_secretstream` equivalent (chunked authenticated encryption over Strumok or
      Kalyna-CTR)
- [x] DSTU 4145: official standard text obtained (`docs/papers/DSTU_4145-2002.pdf`, 2026-07-22) —
      its Annex B.1 (GF(2^163), polynomial basis) worked example extracted into
      `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/dstu4145/gf2m163.json` and independently cross-checked
      byte-for-byte against Bouncy Castle's own hardcoded KAT (`DSTU4145Test.java` `test163()`) —
      see `DECISIONS.md` D-14 and `ORACLES.md`. A genuinely dual-sourced vector, not just a scan
      transcription.
- [ ] DSTU 4145: re-derive `docs/pseudocode/dstu4145.md` against the official text's Sections 5-13
      now that they exist, rather than leaving it as a pure Bouncy Castle code-transcription (see
      the doc's 2026-07-22 update note)
- [ ] DSTU 4145: implement GF(2^m) binary-field + elliptic-curve arithmetic in Rust (does not
      exist in the tree yet — this is the actual prerequisite for a Rust port, bigger than just
      the signature logic itself)
- [ ] DSTU 4145: port the signature scheme to Rust from `docs/pseudocode/dstu4145.md` (once
      re-derived), verified against the `gf2m163.json` vector and Bouncy Castle as the oracle (D-02)
- [ ] **Blocked entirely:** DSTU 9041 — zero source material exists (no paper, no oracle, no
      pseudocode; see `ORACLES.md`). Nothing here can start until the official text is obtained
      or another authoritative source turns up
- [ ] `crypto_kx` equivalent (Diffie–Hellman on the DSTU 4145/9041 curve — needs both to exist)
- [ ] `crypto_sign` equivalent wrapping the Rust DSTU 4145 port

## Phase 3 — Language bindings (not MVP)

- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] JavaScript bindings
- [ ] Java binding (wraps Bouncy Castle `DSTU4145Signer` directly, per D-02 — does not use the
      Rust DSTU 4145 port)
- [ ] .NET binding (wraps Bouncy Castle `Dstu4145Signer` directly, per D-02)
- [ ] C++ bindings

## Phase 4 — Hardware validation (post-MVP)

- [ ] STM32 (ARM Cortex-M) real-hardware validation
- [ ] ESP32 (Xtensa/RISC-V) real-hardware validation
- [ ] Keep the SPA/DPA non-claim intact throughout (`no_std` compiling ≠ side-channel resistance
      — see `CLAUDE.md` MVP scope section)

## Explicitly out of scope — not scheduled in any phase

- Post-quantum DSTU 8961:2019 (Skelya) / DSTU 9212:2023 (Vershyna) — per D-08, only with a
  separate explicit decision from the project owner

## API surface — `dstu_core::hazmat` module by module

Mirrors the table in `docs/dstu-crypto-project.md` "Concrete API shape" — that table is the
prose/rationale version, this is the checklist version. Keep both in sync when a status changes.
Two-layer split (`hazmat` now, high-level "easy" layer later) decided in `DECISIONS.md` D-09.

- [x] `hazmat::kupyna` (`Kupyna256`, `Kupyna512`) — confirmed green, citation in D-10 (see Phase 1)
- [x] `hazmat::kalyna` (5 variants) — confirmed green, citation in D-13 (see Phase 1)
- [x] `hazmat::strumok` (`Strumok256`, `Strumok512`) — confirmed green, citation in D-18 (see
      Phase 1)
- [ ] `hazmat::dstu4145` — not started; needs BC known-answer vectors extracted first (Phase 2)
- [ ] `hazmat::dstu9041` — hard-blocked, zero source material (see `ORACLES.md`)
- [ ] high-level "easy" layer (name TBD) — not started; nothing needs it yet (no keyed/nonce-based
      primitive is implemented before Strumok or `crypto_secretbox`, both currently blocked)
- [ ] `crypto_secretbox` construction (over `hazmat::kalyna` + `hazmat::kupyna`) — blocked on D-05
- [ ] `crypto_auth`/`crypto_onetimeauth` construction (over `hazmat::kupyna`) — needs
      `hazmat::kalyna`/`hazmat::kupyna` done first
- [ ] `crypto_kdf` construction (over `hazmat::kupyna`) — needs `hazmat::kupyna` done first
- [ ] `crypto_kx` construction (over `hazmat::dstu4145`/`dstu9041`) — needs both curves; DSTU 9041
      side is hard-blocked
- [ ] `crypto_secretstream` construction (over `hazmat::strumok`/`hazmat::kalyna`) — needs its
      underlying primitive done first
- [ ] `crypto_pwhash` (plain Argon2id, high-level layer only, not DSTU) — not started, no blocker
- [ ] `randombytes` (OS CSPRNG via `getrandom`, high-level layer only, not DSTU) — not started,
      only needed once the high-level layer exists

## Infrastructure — CI and oracle harnesses

Goal: make "is this primitive actually green" answerable without a human manually running
`cargo test` and reporting back every time (see Phase 1's Kupyna entry above for why this matters
right now). Every harness below consumes the same `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/<algo>/*.json`
files already used by the Rust tests — one vector format, multiple consumers, not a second
convention invented per language.

- [x] Rust CI (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`) written and **locally confirmed green** (2026-07-22,
      after installing a Rust toolchain in this environment — see `.claude.local.md`): `cargo fmt
      --check` clean, `cargo build --workspace` (both `--all-features` and
      `--no-default-features`, confirming `no_std` still compiles), `cargo test --workspace`
      passes (Kupyna's two vector tests included), `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings`
      clean after one fix (`manual_memcpy` in `shift_bytes`). **Kupyna is now confirmed correct**,
      not just written — see D-10 update. `cargo miri test` run separately (see below); CI itself
      still activates properly only once pushed to a GitHub remote.
- [x] `cargo fuzz` scaffold added (`crates/dstu-core/fuzz/`, target `kupyna`) — required by
      `SECURITY.md`. Wired into the CI smoke job; a local nightly+miri toolchain now exists here
      too if a quick local run is ever wanted, though CI is still the primary path.
- [x] `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` (2026-07-22, D-11) — elevated to the same required-CI standing
      as miri/fuzz in `SECURITY.md`; policy in `deny.toml`. Wired into `.github/workflows/rust.yml`
      via `rustsec/audit-check` / `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action`. **Actually run locally, not
      just installed**: `cargo audit` — 0 vulnerabilities. `cargo deny check` — all four categories
      (`advisories`, `bans`, `licenses`, `sources`) pass, but only after a real fix: it caught
      `dstutool`'s `dstu-core = { path = "../dstu-core" }` dependency as a "wildcard dependency"
      (no `version` pinned — would also block publishing to crates.io as-is). Fixed by adding
      `version = "0.0.0"`. Genuine first catch from this tooling, not just a clean no-op.
- [x] ~~C oracle harness~~ **dropped 2026-07-22.** Attempted against cryptonite (pinned commit
      `3618d340`) with a real, newly-installed GCC 16.1: cryptonite's own source fails to compile
      on a modern compiler (implicit-function-declaration errors in
      `dstu4145_prng_internal.c` — unrelated to Kalyna/Kupyna, a real incompatibility in the
      vetted third-party oracle itself, not something to patch). Also triggered a Windows
      Defender heuristic false-positive on CMake's own compiler-ID test binary (confirmed
      contained: exactly one detection, `ActionSuccess: True`, no other findings). Combined with
      already-modest evidentiary value (Kalyna/Kupyna are independently confirmed by the two
      harnesses below already), not worth patching a vetted oracle's source to keep this alive.
      `cryptonite` remains a **read-only** reference (see `ORACLES.md` / `oracles/README.md`, the
      D-05 CCM/GCM finding) — just not a runnable CI harness. `tests/oracle-harness/c/` removed.
- [x] .NET oracle harness (`tests/oracle-harness/dotnet/`) — uses the **published
      `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` 2.6.2** NuGet package, not the vendored partial clone in
      `oracles/bouncycastle-dotnet/` (that's "selected files only" and won't build standalone —
      see `oracles/README.md`). **Actually built and run in this environment**: all 10 Kalyna
      cases + all 12 Kupyna cases passed against real Bouncy Castle output.
- [x] Java oracle harness (`tests/oracle-harness/java/`) — same approach, published
      `bcprov-jdk18on:1.85` from Maven Central rather than the vendored
      `oracles/bouncycastle-java/` clone. **Actually built and run**, both via raw `javac`/`java`
      (JDK 8) and via Maven (installed 2026-07-22, see `.claude.local.md`): same result, all 22
      cases passed both ways.
- [x] `cargo xtask` cross-platform build/QA runner (2026-07-22, D-12) — one command
      (`cargo xtask build|test|fmt|clippy|ci|miri|fuzz|audit|deny|oracle-java|oracle-dotnet`) for
      Linux/Windows/macOS instead of separate shell/PowerShell scripts. Plain Rust binary at
      `xtask/`, own `[workspace]` so it stays out of `dstu-core`'s dependency graph, invoked via the
      `.cargo/config.toml` alias. Optional-tool subcommands check availability and print an install
      hint instead of failing raw. **Actually run locally**: `cargo xtask ci` — mandatory checks
      (fmt/build/test/clippy) pass, then correctly reported `cargo-miri`/`cargo-fuzz`/`mvn` as
      missing in that shell session with install hints while `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`, and
      the .NET oracle harness (all 22 cases) ran and passed. README.md "Building from source" /
      "Development commands" document the per-OS install + usage.
- [x] Extract Bouncy Castle's own DSTU 4145 known-answer test data — done as
      `crates/dstu-core/tests/vectors/dstu4145/gf2m163.json` (2026-07-22, D-14), transcribed from
      the official standard's own Annex B.1 worked example and cross-checked against
      `DSTU4145Test.java` `test163()` rather than extracted from the BC test file directly — same
      end result (a vector both sources agree on), better provenance (spec-first, code-confirmed
      rather than the reverse). The Java/.NET oracle harnesses don't consume it yet (no Rust
      GF(2^m)/EC arithmetic exists to test against — see Phase 2), but the harness code shape is
      ready to add a DSTU 4145 case whenever that lands.

**Independent-value note, don't skip this when reading the checklist above:** the Kalyna/Kupyna
harnesses (C, Java, .NET) mostly re-validate this project's own PDF vector extraction — real
value given the `pdftotext` extraction hazards already hit, but modest. The DSTU 4145 harness is
where a genuinely independent oracle actually buys something. Strumok has no harness above because
no trustworthy runnable oracle exists for it at all (`outspace/dstu8845` is unofficial, unaudited)
— a harness can't manufacture verification authority that doesn't exist upstream.
